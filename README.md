# blender_gif_exporter
**This add-on is incomplete.**
This add-on creates a gif file from multiple images rendered with Blender.

## Why?
I wanted the rendered image to be a GIF file immediately.  

## Where?
`IMAGE_EDITOR > UI > Gif Exporter`

## How to?
Just press the button once you have rendered.  
Refer to the output destination set in Blender and export as a Gif file.
